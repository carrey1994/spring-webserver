The webserver is designed for simple member system.
The frontend is designed for website ui.
The integration-test is used to test the api flow, and it will take test on the github action.
The infra contains yaml of docker and terraform for dev env or local.
The docker-ci-tester.sh is for test on CI instead of local.

There are ways to launch the server on local.
1. If Docker installed,
   Run "./docker-starter.sh -w".
   (The -w flag will pull image from dockerhub for backend server, otherwise script will launch the services except webserver.)
2. If Docker and K3d installed,
   Run "./k3d-starter.sh".
   (If Istio install, the flag '-i' is enable to launch with Istio.)
3. If Docker and Terraform installed,
   Run "./terraform-starter.sh".
